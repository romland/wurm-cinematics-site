# Curious if a graphical setting actually improved performance? How it handles a dense
# village? How much lamps affect the game? You can use this software for benchmarking 
# Wurm (and your computer) with various settings and environments (reproducibility <3 )
#
# Let's test benchmarking...
#
/scene start "Benchmarking Wurm"

	/setup
		tell console "flight"
		option hud off

		# This enables the benchmarking mode.
