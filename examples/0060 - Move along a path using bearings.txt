# Doing things with numbers can sometimes make it a bit more complicated than it needs to be.
#
# So, instead of doing +3 or whatever on X or Y axis, you can use plain English.
#
# We'll use the last example but change it up to use English instead.

/scene start

		tell console "flight"

	# Let's say we want to go somewhere, and then return back to where we started.
	/camera move for 15s
		# First go three tiles south and 200 height upwards
		waypoint 3 south 200 up

		# Next we go 3 tiles east and an additional 100 height upwards (to 300)
		waypoint 3 east 300 up

		# When that is done, we return to where we started -- which is our final destination,
		# the target. We just say, 0 in whatever direction, that will take us back to where
		# we were.
		target 0 north 0 up

		# Directions that work are (clock wise):
		# north, north-northeast, northeast, east-northeast, east, east-southeast, southeast, south-southeast,
		# south, south-southwest, southwest, west-southwest, west, west-northwest, northwest, north-northwest
		#
		# Additionally, up and down works.
		#
		# The above directions can also be abbreviated to make it a bit less verbose:
		# n, nne, ne, ene, e, ese, se, sse, s, ssw, sw, wsw, w, wnw, nw, nnw
		#
		# ...and likewise here: u for up, d for down.
