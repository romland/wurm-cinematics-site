# Let's revisit camera focusing and go around in a circle around our previous focus example.

/scene start
	/setup
		tell console "flight"

	# This is the same trick old trick as earlier. Make sure we have a predictable starting point.
	/camera focus for 0s
		target +5 +5 -80

	# Spend 20 seconds focusing on a tile 5 southeast of us and a bit below.
	/camera focus for 20s
		target +5 +5 -80

	# Move around a point we are focusing on.
	/camera move for 20s
		waypoint 10 south 50 up
		waypoint 15 southeast 50 up
		waypoint 20 southeast 50 up
		waypoint 15 east 50 up
		target 0 east 0 up
