# To assist in synchronizing your scenes with music, you can also play a song.
# Songs should be MP3s and always be located in the cinematics/audio/ folder.
#
# In the default distribution only one song is included, it's by Tagirijus and
# called Ascent.
#
# For experimentation, key moments in the example song are:
#	0:00 drums
#	0:21 drums after pause
#	0:47 violin
#	1:21 rhythmic
#	2:21 boombastic
#	2:35 end
#	2:42 total length
