# Where would we be if we could not set the mood for a scene? In Cinematics you have
# a command to tweak the environment:
#
# /world
#
# It works and looks like all the other commands involving the camera, you have waypoints
# a target, you can wait, and you can use easing or pathing of your choice.
#
/scene start "Setting the stage - time"
	/setup
		option benchmarking on
		option fade on
		option hud off
		wait 1s
		option fade off

	# With time we specify which hour and which minute we want to go to.
	# In the case below, we first go to 23:59 (one minute to midnight),
	# then go to mid-day where we also end our change.
	/world time for 15s
		waypoint 23 59
		target 12 00
		use easing linear inout
		use pathing linear

	/camera focus for 15s
		waypoint +13 +5 +0
		target +3 +5 +0
		use easing quad inout
		use pathing catmull-rom
