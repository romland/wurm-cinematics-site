# So far I've only used full seconds as a unit of time. That is of course not always optimal
# as you very often want more control...
#
# When you see, for example, "3s", that means 3 seconds... the "s" can be also be the following:
# - ms : milliseconds (1000ms = 1s, 9000 = 9s, etc)
# - s  : second
# - m  : minute
# - h  : hour
# - d  : day (I imagine this one will not be used very often)

/scene start "Less than a second"

	# Move camera to +100 height for 3500 milliseconds (3.5 seconds)
	/camera move for 3500ms
		waypoint +0 +0 +100
		target +0 +0 +0

	# Rotate camera 2 degrees for 411 milliseconds (0.4 seconds)
	/camera rotate for 411ms
