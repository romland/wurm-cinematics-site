# This file is a script (as in movie script, not as in programming), it has the .txt 
# extension so they can easily be edited in e.g. notepad.
#
# Below I'll explain what is happening in here.
#

# Every script must have at least one scene. This is how you create a scene.
/scene start

	# This is a camera *command*, we tell the camera to move for 3 seconds (s for seconds).
	/camera move for 3s
		# It will not move on west/east (x), but it will move +3 tiles along north/south (+3 means 3 south).
		# It will also not attempt to change height.
		target +0 +3 +0

# This is how you end a scene.
/scene end
