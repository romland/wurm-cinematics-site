# Where would we be if we could not set the mood for a scene? In Cinematics you have
# a command to tweak the environment:
#
# /world
#
# It works and looks like all the other commands involving the camera, you have waypoints
# a target, you can wait, and you can use easing or pathing of your choice.

/scene start "Setting the stage - wind"
	/setup
		option benchmarking on
		option fade on
		option hud off
		wait 1s
		option fade off

	# Setting the wind is a little bit different from fog, rain, etc...
	# We specify the force and the direction of the wind.

	/camera focus for 15s
