# Naturally it's not optimal to design a whole video in Wurm alone, it's far better to 
# just design separate scenes and then use a video editing program to stich the scenes
# together... This is here mostly to show that simple things can be done.
#
# I don't have the creative spirit when it comes to making videos, and this is the first 
# time I actually try to synchronize video with music. 
#
# That said, here's what I did...
#
# 1. I downloaded a free program called Audacity
# 2. I loaded the example song that comes with Cinematics into Audacity...
# 3. I zoomed in on the audio waves to get more exact timestamps in the song
# 4. I manually analyzed the song to see where key moments were and noted them down with /at commands
#    with a small comment saying what type of sound it was (long, short, etc).
# 5. I started Wurm, and loaded in my script
# 6. I started adding moves at each /at
# 7. ...and hopefully, at some point, I'll be able to consider this example done.
