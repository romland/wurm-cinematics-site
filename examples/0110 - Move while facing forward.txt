# Sometimes you may want to simply focus forward when moving around. This can be done in multiple ways
# and you can do this with a lot more freedom if you look at the example called 
# "Focus ahead with delayed movement".

/scene start
	/setup
		tell console "flight"

	# Easily done, set target to be 'ahead'...
	/camera focus for 20s
		target ahead

	# Move around while we are looking ahead...
	/camera move for 20s
		waypoint 10 south 50 up
		waypoint 15 southeast 50 up
		waypoint 20 southeast 50 up
		waypoint 15 east 50 up

		# Take us back to where we started.
		target 0 east 0 up

/scene end
