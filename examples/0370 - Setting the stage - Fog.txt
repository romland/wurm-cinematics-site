# Where would we be if we could not set the mood for a scene? In Cinematics you have
# a command to tweak the environment:
#
# /world
#
# It works and looks like all the other commands involving the camera, you have waypoints
# a target, you can wait, and you can use easing or pathing of your choice.
#
