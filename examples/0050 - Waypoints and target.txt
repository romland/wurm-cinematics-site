# Up until now we've only moved to a target location and then the scene was done. What 
# actually make things a bit more interesting is the ability to set paths to follow.
#
# Each command must have a target, that's where the camera will end up when it is done,
# in the case below, after 15 seconds.
#
# So, introducing the waypoint...
#
/scene start
	/setup
		tell console "flight"

	# Let's say we want to go somewhere, and then return back to where we started.
	/camera move for 15s
		# First go three tiles south and 200 height upwards
		waypoint +0 -3 +200

		# Next we go 3 tiles east and an additional 100 height upwards (to 300)
		waypoint +3 +0 +300

		# When that is done, we return to where we started -- which is our final destination,
		# the target.
		target +0 +0 +0
/scene end
