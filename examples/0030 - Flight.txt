# Very often when you are creating a scene you will want to move at variable speed and height.
# That's when 'flight' comes in handy. You may want to activate flight automatically when a 
# scene starts running.
#
# We use the same scene as "Hello World" but with a new addition.
#
/scene start
	# Our new addition, the /setup command
	/setup
		# This will make sure flight is enabled when the scene starts running.
		tell console flight

	# This is the same as in "Hello World"
	/camera move for 3s
		target +0 +3 +0
/scene end
