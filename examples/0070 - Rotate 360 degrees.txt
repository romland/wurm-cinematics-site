# This extends on the previous example, and introduces a neat trick.
#
/scene start "360 degree rotation"
	/setup
		tell console "flight"

	# This is a trick you'll find yourself wanting to use pretty often. Basically, when you
	# want to do something for a number of seconds you set that the move should take that long.
	# But very often you simply want to set a current starting position, so we do that with 
	# a command of no duration (0 seconds).
	/camera rotate for 0s
		target 0 0

	# The above made sure that our camera is now facing north and center, so we have a predictable
	# situation to work from.
	/camera rotate for 14s
		# The first half of this rotation we spend going to 180 degrees along X...
		waypoint 180 0

		# ...and the remainder to do a full rotation.
		target 360 0

		# We do not touch the Y axis (look up or down) at all in this example.
/scene end
