#
# In the previous examples I just covered easings, which says how a command should start and end.
#
# There's another use for the "use" keyword, and that is how commands should transition from one
# waypoint to another. Without transition between waypoints we'd get a rather artificial feeling
# to our movements.
#
# So, introducing: use pathing ...
#
# Currently there are only two different pathings implemented:
# - linear
# - catmull-rom
#
# If not specified "Cinematics" will always use catmull-rom, but there are definitely cases where 
# you just want similar linear movement to make sure you really go through your control point.

	/camera move for 20s
		waypoint 10 south 50 up
		waypoint 15 southeast 50 up
		waypoint 20 southeast 50 up
		waypoint 15 east 50 up
		target 0 east 0 up

		# We don't actually need to specify quad, since that is default. But doing it for clarity.
		use easing quad inout

		# Use linear pathing between waypoints instead of the default catmull-rom...
		use pathing linear
