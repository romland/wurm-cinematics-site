# This is the first time we use several camera movements with a duration in the same scene.
#
# All commands will run simultaneously. There are several ways to get commands to not do this,
# including multiple scenes, but we'll get to that a bit later on.
#
# What we're going to do here is focus on a location and move a bit.
#
/scene start
	/setup
		tell console "flight"

	# This is the same trick as we did earlier. We want to quickly go to our destination without 
	# wasting time. The only difference now is that we use a new type of camera movement. 
	# 
	# The 'focus' type.
	/camera focus for 0s
		target 5 southeast 80 down

	# Like above, but this time spend 20 seconds holding that focus. It will do this on the tile 
	# 5 tiles southeast and a bit below us.
	/camera focus for 20s
		target 5 southeast 80 down

	# This command will run simultaneously with the one above, let's go 15 tiles east and 100 up.
	/camera move for 20s
		target 15 east 100 up

/scene end
