#
# Instead of using a lot of "wait"s or splitting up very minor parts into multiple scenes,
# you can use the "/at" command to run a few commands simultaneously and have another few
# commands start at another time.
#
# The /at command makes it a lot easier to do synchronized things without having to change
# dozens of 'wait' instructions.
#
# This demonstrates two parts starting at two different times. One 4 seconds in, and the
# second 14 seconds in.
