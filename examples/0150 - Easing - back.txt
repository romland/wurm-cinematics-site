# You may have forgotten it, but your scene does not have to have flight enabled. In this case
# we are not even moving, just using focus. 
#
# But, what is an easing? It's an algorithm that controls the speed of, for instance, an animation.
# This will give a desired effect, whether it be a smooth move, linear move, a bouncing move or
# what have you. We will go through the available easings in Friya's Cinematics in the next few
# examples.
#
# Do note that the easing algorithms can be applied to rotate, move, focus (and other things not yet 
# introduced). In our examples here we do however always use 'focus' to easily compare between them.
#
# If you do not specify an easing, "quad" is used by default.
#
