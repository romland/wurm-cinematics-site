# Let's name this scene, it looks better in the Cinematics tab in-game. I call it "Simple Rotation",
# and then append that to /scene start.
#
/scene start "Simple Rotation"
	/setup
		tell console "flight"

	# New type of camera movement here, "rotate". Works just like a "/camera move" but instead
	# just pans the view.
	#
	# We tell it to take 4 seconds to get to the target (+20 degrees in the case below)
	/camera rotate for 4s
		# Pan the camera +20 degrees along X, leave Y alone.
		target +20 +0
/scene end
