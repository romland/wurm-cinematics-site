# We just did follow the creature, now let's just look at a creature as it moves...
#
# In order to run this scene you will need to pick a target to look at, once you have
# done that, enter its ID into the designated place below.
#
# Q: How do you get the ID of an object?
# A: Right click on a creature, then go into the menu: 
#    Friya's Cinematics -> Scene Designer -> Get object ID
#
# Note down the number (ID), then replace ID_HERE with the creature's ID.
#
/scene start "Look-at example"
	/setup
		tell cinematics "We need a creature to look at in order to run this, please edit the script for instructions..."

	# The script will run for 60 seconds, but you can of course stop it at any point...
	/camera focus for 60s
		target creature ID_HERE
		use easing quad inout

/scene end
